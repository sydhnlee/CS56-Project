# CS56-Project

Initial tasks that I'd like each person to accomplish:

Syd - 
       Create rough draft of the GreetScreen window with JavaFX (Buttons, TextFields and other necessary nodes should be implemented)
       Add functionality so that information entered into TextFields is used to create an instance of User class
       
Ki - 
       Create rough draft of the GoalSelection window with JavaFX (Buttons and any other necessary nodes should be implemented)
       
Luis -
       Create the BodyPart class as well as a class for each actual part of the body and make them extend BodyPart
       
Jose - 
       Code in the calculation of the number of calories and macronutrients a specific User should be eating. No JavaFx necessary yet. Here
       is a link to a website that contains all the formulas you'll need: https://healthyeater.com/how-to-calculate-your-macros. For now,
       only calculate how much a User will need to eat to maintain their current weight. You'll see what I mean when you read the website.
       
Soon - Create the Exercise class and compile a list of 2-4 exercises that focus on each major body part (quads, calfs, biceps, lats, etc).
       Once this list is created, implement each exercise as its own class and have them extend the Exercise class.
       
       
IMPORTANT NOTE: BodyPartSelection and RecommendExercises will most likely take the most time to complete so it will be something we all
                work on together.
